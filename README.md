University of Helsinki's MOOC Data analysis with python course that I have done during my free time for my interest in coding and data analysis. 
The course takes a practical approach to different phases of data analysis pipeline. After the course you can select subsets, transform, reshape and combine data. You learn to visualize data as simple plots or histograms.
